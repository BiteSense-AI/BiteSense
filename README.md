Bite Sense is an app that uses AI to identify and diagnose insect bites quickly. A user can upload pictures of their bite and through the use of a convolutional neural network, the app will classify what kind of bite it is. The app also has a chatbot that is trained to know all about insect bites and how to treat them. Users can tell the chatbot about their symptoms, and it will tell them how to best treat the bite. The app also includes interactive heat maps describing where bugs are based on user submitted bite reports. Users can also log and view the history of their bug bites, and connect with dermatologists within the app. Bite Sense can greatly help those who are allergic to certain insect bites, as they would be able to quickly check if they need to seek emergency care, potentially saving lives.
